  <h2> The System </h2> 
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2> System Components </h2>
    <ul>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">Libraries (core + interfaces)</li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">APIs (desktop, mobile, web)</li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">(DS) Language</li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">Frontends and Applications</li>
  </ul>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
    <section>
  <h2> Libraries (core + interfaces) </h2>
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>
The core of Csound is a library that contains a compiler for
its DSL, a performance engine for audio processing, and 
over 1,750 unit generators (internal + plugins), as well as audio/MIDI
backends.
  </p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>
In addition to these, an interfaces library that is wrapped in various
languages, as well as some some specific platform libraries 
(CsoundObj for OSX/iOS/Android/Web).
  </p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section>
  <h2> APIs (desktop, mobile, web) </h2>
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>
The fundamental Csound API is provided in C, with a corresponding
C++ interface. These are wrapped in various languages: Java, Python,
Clojure, Lua, Lisp, etc.
  </p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>
In addition, Csound provides a separate `interfaces' API that has some
facilities for wrapped code, as well as threading support.
  </p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>
Finally, the CsoundObj API is a layer above the fundamental one, 
supporting mainly mobile and web programming (Objective-C, Java, JS).
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section>
  <h2> The Language </h2>
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>
  Csound is a DS language designed to describe very precisely, but also
succinctly, audio signal processing. Its main unit of programming is 
  the <it>instrument</it>, which defines an object that process sound.
  </p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>
The instrument can be instantiated any number of times; its code is
composed of expressions involving variables of various types, possibly
containing unit generators (defined by opcodes or functions).
  </p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>
Unit generators can be either internal/plugin (provided by the system),
or defined in the code (user-defined opcodes, UDOs).

  <h2> Frontends </h2>
  </section>
  <section>
 <p> The system is driven by a variety of frontends/applications, some of them
maintained as part of the Csound project: </p>
    <ul>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">Csound CLI interface</li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">Csound6~ and Csound~ classes for PD/MaxMSP</li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">CsLADSPA plugin generator</li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">PNaCl Csound for web apps</li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in"><a
  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csounds.Csound6"
      target="_blank">
  Csound for Android</a></li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">Csound Examples for iOS/Android</li>
  </ul>
  </section>
    <section>
 <p> There are also several third-party frontends, of which four are
of note: </p>
    <ul>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">CsoundQT IDE</li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">Cabbage plugin + standalone IDE</li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">Blue: composition system</li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">WinXSound: editor with CLI integration</li>
  <li class="fragment fade-in">CsoundUnity: frontend for the game engine</li>
  </ul>
  </section>

</section>

  <h2>Uses</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2> Application development </h2>
  <p>
Csound is heavily used for application development
under various platforms. 
  </p>
<p>
For example, there are many iOS apps available whose sound engine is
provided by Csound. Another example is AudioKit,
which is an application framework that is completely
based on Csound (third-party).
</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2> Research </h2>
<p>
Csound is also employed as research environment for a
digital signal processing, computer music language
development, parallel computing (e.g. GPGPUs), sonification,
psychoacoustics, etc.
</p>
<p>
It can be used alone, or in combination with scripting
languages such as Python, and scientific modules.
  For instance, the <b> icsound </b>module, which is another frontend provided
by the system, allows for easy integration with the iPython environment.
</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>Live electronics
  </h2>
<p>
Csound can be used for live electronics setups, as it can deliver
very efficient implementations of audio processing with low-latency
support. Interfaces can be constructed using its various frontends,
or via scripting. Network, OSC and MIDI are readily available
for integration.
  <p>
  </p>
In particular, its use of MIDI is very straightforward, allowing the
easy development of software synthesizers directly as Csound
instruments (with no need for low-level message management,
voice allocation, etc., although this is also possible if required)
</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2> Installations, IoMT </h2>
Due to its wide connectivity options, Csound has been used as
the main component in various installations. An example is
Flounder in Norway, an open air installation that is being streamed
to the web, and that has been running continuously since 2006.
  <p>
  </p>
Lately, with the introduction of small computing devices, Csound
can be used as a sound engine for Internet of Musical Things
applications (e.g. distributed, interactive devices, etc 
across the network) </p>
  </section>
  <section>
<h2> Composition, Music Production </h2>
<p>
Csound was originally designed as an environment for computer
music creation, and it still is. Not only it provides an unrivalled
sonic palette, but it also allows users to navigate between various
systems and languages, in coordination with it. 
</p>
<p>
For instance, Csound can be used to develop plugins for a
wide variety of hosts, and thus can be easily integrated into
a music production workflow.
</p>
  </section>
</section>
  <section>
  <section>
  <h2> A Composition Case Study<h2>
  </section>
  <section>
<h2>Peeglid</h2>
<p>
This is a piece for voice, flute, kannel, cello, and computer. The
latter part is performed by Csound.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
The title of the piece, <it> Peeglid </it>, 'mirrors' in Estonian, refers
to the basic idea developed in the piece: <it> recursion </it>. Recursion
is a form of self introspection, and it is used in three ways in this
piece: as a programming approach; melodically; and defining the large-scale
sonic palette.  
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2> Programming </h2>
<p>
Csound supports recursion very well, at various levels. The one type
used here is sometimes called <it> temporal recursion </it>. We
can exemplify it with a simple instrument:
<div id="editor4"></div>
</p>
</section>

<section>
  <H2> Melodic recursion </H2>
<p>
The idea of recursive sequences is extended to the development of
melodic material. Many of the lines played by the instruments are
based on recursive patterns where each sub-phrase contains a
copy of the whole.
  <p>
  </p>
From this basic principle, I composed the melodic lines, emphasising
some specific pitches, depending on the context and the musical
gestures I wanted to create.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <H2>Sound palette </H2>
<p>
Mirroring occurs in the sound palette by the use of synthesised material
that connects to one or more of the live instruments. Each section of
the piece is defined by a <it> signature </it> timbre, which are connected to
the original ensemble sounds.
  <p>
  </p>
For instance, this is very clear in the beginning, where there is a 
mirroring between the kannel and the synthesised plucked-string
sounds of the computer.
</p>
</section>
<section>
  <H2>Practical aspects </h2>
<p>  
The computer part does not use any live audio inputs; however it uses
indeterminacy heavily: performances are guaranteed never to be 
the same. This works both in terms of how the sounds are generated,
and also the duration of certain sections.
</p>
In order to keep the performers synchronised, two methods can be used:
a GUI displaying the section and time in seconds (performing computer
screen); a mobile app (for android) displaying the same information,
connected via OSC (through wifi).
